## Single-file methods to consider

: Main file is an HTML file, XML is loaded with an iframe and ~~srcdoc~~
; Just use data URI to support older browsers
; Would ~~require JS on older browsers (https://github.com/jugglinmike/srcdoc-polyfill), but~~ make the file smaller and the logic leaner, and open fine from local storage on mobile (.XML doesn't)

: Main file is XML, the JS logic reconstructs the data from the HTML body the browser processed
; More complicated but should give better support on older browsers
